config QPNP_POWER_ON
	tristate "QPNP PMIC POWER-ON Driver"
	depends on OF_SPMI && (SPMI || MSM_SPMI) && MSM_QPNP_INT && INPUT
	help
	  This driver supports the power-on functionality on Qualcomm
	  PNP PMIC. It currently supports reporting the change in status of
	  the KPDPWR_N line (connected to the power-key).

config QPNP_REVID
	tristate "QPNP Revision ID Peripheral"
	depends on SPMI || MSM_SPMI
	help
	  Say 'y' here to include support for the Qualcomm QPNP REVID
	  peripheral. REVID prints out the PMIC type and revision numbers
	  in the kernel log along with the PMIC option status. The PMIC
	  type is mapped to a Qualcomm chip part number and logged as well.

config QPNP_COINCELL
	tristate "Qualcomm QPNP coincell charger support"
	depends on (SPMI || MSM_SPMI) && OF_SPMI
	help
	  This driver supports the QPNP coincell peripheral found inside of
	  Qualcomm QPNP PMIC devices.  The coincell charger provides a means to
	  charge a coincell battery or backup capacitor which is used to
	  maintain PMIC register state when the main battery is removed from the
	  mobile device.

config QPNP_HAPTIC
	tristate "Haptic support for QPNP PMIC"
	depends on OF_SPMI
	help
	  This option enables device driver support for the Haptic
	  on the Qualcomm Technologies' QPNP PMICs. It uses the android
	  timed-output framework.

config GPIO_USB_DETECT
	tristate "GPIO-based USB VBUS Detection"
	depends on POWER_SUPPLY
	help
	  This driver supports external USB VBUS detection circuitry whose
	  output is connected to a GPIO. The driver in turn notifies the
	  USB driver of VBUS presence/disconnection using the power_supply
	  framework.
